App geared towards linguistics and literature with a focus on prosody and poetry.

I recently contemplated rewriting my metrical scansion engine for Urdu in Typescript as part of a version 2.0 of my web application. I will briefly list the rationale and the outcomes of the project below.

#### ****Objectives****

*   Pure Typescript implementation to remove the need for a backend.
*   Experiment with newer UI/UX techniques.
*   Make a Single Page Application for a more fluid experience.
*   Make an installable Progressive Web App that can run on all platforms.

#### ****Result****

*   The app engine turned out fine. Slower than my C++ implementation but still reasonably fast. It's mostly a rewrite of my Kotlin Android implementation.
*   Clean codebase that relies heavily on functional programming techniques.
*   Installable Progressive Web App that works offline on all platforms.
*   Fluid UI with Gatsby and React.

Eventually I decided to embed the app into a somewhat multipurpose website.
