Each quiescent letter is represented with “1”\nwhile each mobile letter is represented with “0”. If two or more quiescent letters occur adjacent to each other in a consonant cluster then their joint representation amounts to “01”</p>\n<p>This approach mirrors what had been\nformalised by Al-Khalīl ibn Aḥmad al-Farāhīdī and is thereby closer to the essence of Urdu prosody. </p>\n<p>Urdu is a syllable timed language\nand a stress based system like the one we see in English which introduces the concept of long and short syllables ought not to be mirrored for Urdu in my opinion. </p>\n<h2>Representation</h2>\n<p>A few words with their representation in the binary system I have devised is given in the table below.</p>\n<style>\ntd, th {\n  font-size: 2.4rem\n}\n</style>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Encoding</th>\n<th>Word</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>۰۱</td>\n<td>کَا</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>۱۰۱</td>\n<td>مَاْنْ</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>۰۱۰۱</td>\n<td>غَاْلِبْ</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Output</h2>\n<p>For the sake of simplicity and avoiding confusion, I have tried to avoid displaying this binary encoding everywhere.\nTo achieve this the programme highlights the letters that are disrupting the rythm only. </p>\n<p>For a rythmically perfect line the programme also\ntries to quantify the fluidity of the line with the help of an algorithm which takes shortened vowels into account.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Guidelines","date":"May 05, 2019","description":"Let's get started.","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAACwAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwC06BZeeo8yPREBgAD+7NfeURNAWrp6Im40St+RI1+dpO0K3+8HCTtnK6ENFUpVfQw1U34F23poTl84tLnKAAA=","aspectRatio":1.780104712041885,"src":"/static/90ba4d548a21fe9712e34e8956f8ab32/9ae12/guide.webp","srcSet":"/static/90ba4d548a21fe9712e34e8956f8ab32/ec8d4/guide.webp 340w,\n/static/90ba4d548a21fe9712e34e8956f8ab32/8829b/guide.webp 680w,\n/static/90ba4d548a21fe9712e34e8956f8ab32/9ae12/guide.webp 1360w,\n/static/90ba4d548a21fe9712e34e8956f8ab32/3b820/guide.webp 2040w,\n/static/90ba4d548a21fe9712e34e8956f8ab32/c7c2c/guide.webp 2520w","sizes":"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/clean-lines/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hi-folks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings","tags":["writings","translation"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/darkness/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Darkness","tags":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
